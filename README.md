# VSTS Admin Tools

The VSTS Admin Tools allow you to perform many actions on both Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). You can find out [why](http://vsts-bulk-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why) this tooling exists and you can access the [documentation](http://vsts-bulk-editor.readthedocs.io) to find out how. THis project is published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/vsts-sync-migration/) as well as a [VSTS Sync Migration Tools on Chocolaty](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/) and [VSTS Bulk Data Editor Engine on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VSTS.DataBulkEditor.Engine/). This allows you to build your own tooling as well as just use it out of the box with a configuration file.
